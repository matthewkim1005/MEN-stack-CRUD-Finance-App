# Matt's Finance Application
HTML/JS/CSS Unit 2 Project: Finance Application

Decription: This is a banking/transaction finance application that keeps track of transactions that the user enters. It keeps details of the date, price, item, transaction type, and store. Users can only see transaction that they have submitted so it is confidential information. The users are kept in a MongoDB database as well as their transactions.

Reason I chose this application: I often find myself forgetting which transactions I have had through the months, this might actually help me keep track of the spending and deposits.
